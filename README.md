# React-Native Typescript with Redux starter

This starter is based on the most famous typescript template [react-native-template-typescript](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript).

It adds a good barebone of redux (with redux persist) and uses mainly hooks

It follows [React redux Typescript style guide](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide)

## WIP
