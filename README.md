# React-Native Typescript with Redux starter

This starter is based on the most famous typescript template [react-native-template-typescript](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript).

It adds a good barebone of redux (with redux persist) and uses mainly hooks

It follows [React redux Typescript style guide](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide)

## WIP

### todo

- [ ] add a basic redux module (_to show types use_)
- [ ] add a HOC (_to show types_)
- [ ] upgrade [react-native-cli 2.x](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) (_=> react-native 0.60+_)
- [ ] ensure auto linking (RN 0.60?) does link fonts assets as previous `react-native link` did before
- [ ] add eslint (_TSlint deprecation_)
